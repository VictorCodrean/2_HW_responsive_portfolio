## Description
Responsive design to ensure web applications to render well on a variety devices or screen sizes. Using the Bootstrap CSS Framework helped us to minimize the use of media queries, utilizing the **GRID system** (container, rows and columns).

## About
* Consistent Navbar from Boostrap for each page.
    *  On each page contain links to Home/About, Contact, and Portfolio page.
* Main element in a container:
    * 1 row and a column that occupies 8 spaces out of 12. (rule of 12 Bootstrap Gryd System)
* Consistent Footer from Bootstrap for each page.

## Contact
* Consistent Navbar from Boostrap for each page.
    *  On each page contain links to Home/About, Contact, and Portfolio page.
* Main element in a container:
    * 1 row and 2 columns...
    * 2-nd column nested inside 1-st column (because 2-nd column leaves 2gryd lines free    of space)
* Consistent Footer from Bootstrap for each page.

## Portfolio
* Consistent Navbar from Boostrap for each page.
    *  On each page contain links to Home/About, Contact, and Portfolio page.
* Main element in a container:
    * 1 main row and column that occupies 8 spaces out of 12. (rule of 12 Bootstrap Gryd System)
    * inside the main column there are 3 more rows with other 2 columns nested inside of each row except the 3-rd row with only one column.
